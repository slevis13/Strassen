# strassen-algorithm
An implementation of Strassen's algorithm. Efficiently multiplies matrices using a recursive, divide-and-conquer approach.

The main program is at "strassen.c"; "int_gen.c" generates a text file made of random 1's and 0's. "int_gen.c" must be run before "strassen.c", as the main program reads its matrices in from the text file.
